SERVICE NOVIGRAD


All the features work fine. As the last release version, not all the details might be visible in the appropriate frame. It will therefore be necessary to use the "up" and "down" buttons on the keyboard to browse these lists in their entirety.

The administrator email is admin@gmail.com and the password is 123456789


It is possible to create a user who can be either an employee or a customer. When creating it, the user password should be more than 7 characters.

Once in the employee's profile, the employee will be able to update his profile and add services to his branch. He will also be able to see all the requests of customers who applied for a service in his branch, with the possibility of accepting and denying. It's also possible for a branch to set up a schedule

A Customer on his way will be able to update his profile as well, apply for a service, view them and see all his/her requests. Also, he will be able to rate all branches in the Novigrad company


if you don't want to create a customer or employee profile, you can use these existing one:
-employee: max@gmail.com  password= maxlouis
-customer: luc@hotmail.com password= luclucluc
(Note that those accounts might be deleted soon due to us working on the app daily)
